Hello ✌️

I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. I went to university in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. My academic 🎓 background is a mix of maths 🧮, economics 💸, and computer science 🖥️. I got hooked into data science in 2014 after watching [Moneyball](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Moneyball_(film)) ⚾ and reading [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Signal_and_the_Noise) 📖

Currently I work at [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/), where we measure the carbon footprint of clothing items 🍃. Before that I worked for [Alan](https://alan.com/), a health insurance company. My [PhD topic](/blog/phd-about) was about machine learning applied to [query optimisation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Query_optimization) in relational databases 🤖. My areas of interest are around [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning) 🍥, document processing 🔬, as well as data analytics and tooling 🛠️

I enjoy programming and [maintaining open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). In particular, I'm one of the founding members of [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) 🌊, which is a Python 🐍 library for online machine learning. I'm a [Kaggle competitions Master](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford) 🏆 and take an interest in competitive data science. I also get a kick out of giving talks and writing blog posts.

Besides work, I like spending time reading 📚, watching movies 🍿, biking 🚲, juggling 🤹, playing frisbee 🥏, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking 🍲. My favorite snack is a [peanut butter 🥜 and banana 🍌 sandwich](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2020/08/25/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwiches/). My go-to beer is Guinness ☘️. I have a [brother](https://0x5.be/) who's into ~~physics and operating systems~~ loads of stuff. My mother runs a quirky shop in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/).
