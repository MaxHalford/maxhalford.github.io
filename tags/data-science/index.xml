The notebook decomposes a ratio, but the logic is also valid for decomposing a sum.
Motivation Say you&amp;rsquo;re a data analyst at a company. You&amp;rsquo;ve built a dashboard with several KPIs. You&amp;rsquo;re happy because it took you a couple of days of hard work. You even went the extra mile of writing unit tests.</description></item><item><title>Graph components with DuckDB</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/graph-components-duckdb/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/graph-components-duckdb/</guid><description>Introduction Graph problems are quite common. However, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to have access to a database offering graph semantics. There are graph databases, such as Neo4j and GraphX, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to justify setting one of those up. One could simply use networkx in Python. But that only works if the graph fits in memory.
From a practical angle, the fact is that people are querying data warehouses in SQL. There are many good reasons to write graph algorithms in SQL.</description></item><item><title>Metric correctness doesn't matter, consistency does</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/consistent-metrics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/consistent-metrics/</guid><description>According to the United Nations, the 15th of November was the day we crossed 8 billion humans on the planet. How can they be so sure of that? Surely there has to be some margin of error, meaning it could have happened on the 14th or 16th. Then again, does it matter?
I would argue almost all metrics we look at are incorrect. For instance, I work at a company who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to measure the carbon footprint of clothing items.</description></item><item><title>Are Airbnb guests less energy efficient than their host?</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</guid><description>TLDR I compared the energy consumption of Airbnb guests versus their host, in the same appartment, during 2022. It appears that guests do in fact consume more energy than hosts. The data I used is available to any Airbnb host. I also open-sourced all the code I wrote for this analysis.
Introduction European energy prices have soared in 2022. It&amp;rsquo;s gone to the point where some Airbnb hosts have become reluctant to rent, believing their guests are too wasteful and cost too much.</description></item><item><title>Docker for data science @ HelloFresh Berlin</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Predire la disponibilit√© des Velib' @ Toulouse Data Science Meetup</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/forecasting-bicycle-sharing-usage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/forecasting-bicycle-sharing-usage/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
