On-screen TV keyboards I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending time at my brother&amp;rsquo;s place. We usually eat in front of TV. I&amp;rsquo;ve thus found myself typing stuff on the Netflix/Amazon/Plex TV apps. The typing happens through a remote controller, which is slower than typing with ones fingers. However, the TV apps usually suggest the correct show/movie after five or six keystrokes, so it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
