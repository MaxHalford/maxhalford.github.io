This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). These two tools cover most of my Python development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the virtual environment and the `.local` directory.

I like to use [custom actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) for this type of stuff. These are base actions that canÂ be re-used in multiple workflows. I have a custom action to install the Python environment. Here's the action file:

```yaml
# .github/actions/install-env.yml

name: Install Python env

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up python
      id: setup-python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"

    - name: Load cached venv
      id: cached-poetry-dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: .venv
        key: venv-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('poetry.lock') }}-${{ hashFiles('.github/actions/install-env/action.yml') }}-${{ steps.setup-python.outputs.python-version }}

    - name: Load cached .local
      id: cached-dotlocal
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: ~/.local
        key: dotlocal-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('.github/actions/install-env/action.yml') }}-${{ steps.setup-python.outputs.python-version }}

    - name: Install Python poetry
      uses: snok/install-poetry@v1
      with:
        virtualenvs-create: true
        virtualenvs-in-project: true
        installer-parallel: true
        virtualenvs-path: .venv
      if: steps.cached-dotlocal.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'

    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: bash
      if: steps.cached-poetry-dependencies.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      run: poetry install --no-interaction

    - name: Activate environment
      shell: bash
      run: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Technically, this is a [composite action](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/36861), which you don't have to worry about. It has a few steps to install Python, cache the virtual environment, and install Poetry. The last step activates the virtual environment. The action is used in a workflow file -- e.g. for units tests -- as so:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/unit-tests.yml

name: Unit tests

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "*"
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: ./.github/actions/install-env
      - run: poetry run pytest
```

Here's a GitHub Action to run pre-commit checks:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/code-quality.yml

name: Code quality

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "*"
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: ./.github/actions/install-env
      - name: Run pre-commit on all files
        run: poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

The immediate benefit of this setup is that the virtual environment and the `.local` directory are cached. This means the environment is ready to use in a few seconds. The action installs Poetry and the dependencies the first time it runs. The next time, it doesn't need to install Poetry because it's already cached in the `.local` directory. Likewise for the virtual environment.

This can be a huge time saver. This has reduced the setup time at [Carbonfact](https://github.com/carbonfact) from ~45 seconds to ~8 seconds. The remaining installation time is spent downloading the caches, which can be subject to variance due to network conditions.

I didn't write this from scratch. I stumbled on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/snok/install-poetry/issues/43), which led me to [this blog post](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/install-python-poetry-github-actions-faster). I also used [this tutorial](https://pre-commit.com/#managing-ci-caches) from the pre-commit docs. I made a few tweaks, but the credit goes to the original authors. My wish is simply to share the knowledge so that we all benefit from it.

Spread the knowledge!
