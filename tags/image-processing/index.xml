Especially those from the golden era of francophone comics: Thorgal, Lanfeust, XIII, Tintin, Largo Winch, Blacksad, Aldebaran, etc.
It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get my hands on many of them. Luckily enough I found a website called ReadComicOnline which is delightfully profuse. It gives access to comics for free under the murky &amp;ldquo;fair use&amp;rdquo; copyright doctrine. I&amp;rsquo;m very doubtful about the legality of the website, but I&amp;rsquo;m still using it for lack of a better option.</description></item><item><title>Halftoning with Go - Part 2</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-2/</guid><description>The next stop on my travel through the world of halftoning will be the implementation of Weighted Voronoi Stippling as described in Adrian Secord&amp;rsquo;s 2002 paper. This method is more involved than the ones I detailed in my previous blog post, however the results are quite interesting. Again, I did the implementation in Go.
Notice the black dot in the middle of the white square? Overview I found a fair amount of resources about the method, most of them being implementations of Adrian Secord&amp;rsquo;s paper.</description></item><item><title>Halftoning with Go - Part 1</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</guid><description>Recently I stumbled upon this webpage which shows how to use a TSP solver as a halftoning technique. I began to read about related concepts like dithering and stippling. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any background in photography but I can appreciate the visual appeal of these techniques. As I understand it these techniques were first invented to save ink for printing. However nowadays printing has become cheaper and the modern use of these technique is mostly aesthetic, at least for images.</description></item></channel></rss>
