The fundamental difference with WebSockets is that the communication only goes in one direction. In other words, the client cannot send information to the server. For many usecases this is all you might need. Indeed, if you just want to receive notifications/updates/messages, then using a WebSocket is overkill. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve implemented the SSE functionality on your server, then all you need on a JavaScript client is an EventSource.</description></item><item><title>Setting up a droplet to host a Flask app</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-droplet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-droplet/</guid><description>After having worked for some weeks on the OpenBikes website, it was time to put it online. Digital Ocean seemed to provide a good service and so I decided to give it a spin. Their documentation is quite good but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover exactly everything for setting up Flask. In this post I simply want to record every single step I took.
OpenBikes is a project with a Flask backend and a few upstart jobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
