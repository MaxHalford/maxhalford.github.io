It&amp;rsquo;s my first real job, and certainly the place where I grew up the most professionally. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to summarise what I did and what I learnt at Alan.
Alan is a special company. It has a unique culture that is starting to become famous in France. I won&amp;rsquo;t expand on the way things work at Alan, and will simply focus on the way I experienced it.</description></item><item><title>What my PhD was about</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/phd-about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/phd-about/</guid><description>I defended my PhD thesis on the 12th of October 2020, exactly 3 years and 11 days after having started it. The title of my PhD is Machine learning for query selectivity estimation in relational databases. I thought it would be worthwhile to summarise what I did. Note sure anyone will read this, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to remember what I did when I grow old and senile.</description></item></channel></rss>
