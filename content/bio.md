Hello ✌️

I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. I went to university in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. My academic 🎓 background is a mix of maths 🧮, economics 💸, and computer science 🖥️. Fun fact: I got hooked into data science in 2014 after watching Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill nerding it out in [Moneyball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) ⚾

At present I'm Head of Data at [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/), where we measure the carbon footprint of clothing items 🍃. Before that I worked for [Alan](https://alan.com/), a health insurance company. My [PhD topic](/blog/phd-about) was about machine learning applied to [query optimisation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Query_optimization) in relational databases 🤖. My areas of expertise are around [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning) 🍥, [document processing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Document_processing) 🔬, as well as data analytics and tooling 🛠️

I enjoy programming and [maintaining open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). In particular, I co-created [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) 🌊, an online machine learning library written in Python 🐍. I'm a [Kaggle competitions Master](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford) 🏆 and take an interest in competitive data science. I also get a kick out of writing blog posts and occasionally giving talks 🤓

Besides work, I like to spend time reading 📚, watching movies 🍿, cycle touring 🚲, juggling 🤹, playing frisbee 🥏, looking at -- and sometimes [making](https://github.com/MaxHalford/procedural-art) -- modern art, and cooking 🍲. My favorite snack is a [peanut butter 🥜 and banana 🍌 sandwich](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2020/08/25/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwiches/). My go-to beer is Guinness ☘️. I have a [brother](https://0x5.be/) who's into ~~physics and operating systems~~ loads of stuff. My mother runs a quirky restaurant/shop in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/) 🪅
