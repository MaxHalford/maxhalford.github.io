## Disclaimer

*Let me be absolutely clear: I think dbt is a great tool. Although this post is a rant, the goal is to be constructive and suggest an improvement.*

## dbt in a nutshell

[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) is a workflow orchestrator for SQL. In other words, it's a fancy [Make](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Make_(software)) for data analytics. What makes dbt special is that it is the first workflow orchestrator that is dedicated to the SQL language. It said out loud what many data teams were thinking: you can get a lot done with SQL.

A workflow orchestrator is necessary to organise tasks into a DAG, and then execute (a subset of) tasks in the correct order. Some orchestrators need to be told which tasks depend on other tasks. Other might determine dependencies automatically. A good orchestrator should trivialise this operation and make you feel productive.

## The good

The emergence of dbt is one of the nicest things that happened to the data analytics field in recent years.

There's no doubt about dbt being an influencial tool. Instead of improving an existing workflow, it created its own paradigm. To me, it feels like what scikit-learn did for machine learning with its fit/predict concept, or what columnar databases did when they ousted Hadoop. dbt is setting a standard which most of its users seem to agree on.

dbt encourages you to massage your data in SQL rather than in, say, Python. SQL is a language that [was designed](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SQL) to manipulate data, which is likely why dbt feels so natural. The rumors that [many teams are adopting it](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/next-layer-of-the-modern-data-stack/) is a testimony to dbt's pervasiveness.

Just this week I chuckled while reading [blef.fr](https://www.blef.fr/), when I learned about a new tool called [fal](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal). The latter presents itself as "dbt for Python". To me that's just a sexier way to say "Airflow". The fact that dbt is generating offsprings tells you it caught the Zeitgeist. In short, dbt is *Ã  la mode*.

## The bad

And yet, from where I stand, all that glitters is not gold.

One of dbt's central features is the `ref` function. In fact, to quote their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref):

> The most important function in dbt is ref(); it's impossible to build even moderately complex models without it.

With dbt, instead of writing literal table names, you reference them:

```sql
-- before
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM users
LEFT JOIN purchases
GROUP BY user_id

-- after
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('users') }}
LEFT JOIN {{ ref('purchases') }}
GROUP BY user_id
```

What's the point? Again, I'll quote the documentation:

> `ref()` is, under the hood, actually doing two important things. <span style="color: forestgreen;">First, it is interpolating the schema into your model file to allow you to change your deployment schema via configuration.</span> <span style="color: indianred;">Second, it is using these references between models to automatically build the dependency graph. This will enable dbt to deploy models in the correct order when using `dbt run`.</span>

The crux of my rant is around their <span style="color: indianred;">second point</span>. I hate that you have to specify dependencies by hard-coding them with `ref(something)`. It feels like the opposite of magic. I shouldn't have to hold dbt's hand and tell it what my query depends on. I would instead expect dbt to parse my SQL and determine the dependencies by itself. From my experience, you can already get a lot covered with a bit of regex:

```py
import re

query = """
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM users
LEFT JOIN purchases
GROUP BY user_id
"""

pattern = (
    r'(FROM|(LEFT|RIGHT|INNER|OUTER)? JOIN) (?P<table>\w+)'
)

dependencies = {
    match.group("table")
    for match in re.finditer(pattern, query)
}
```

The thing I dislike about `ref` is that I can't just copy/paste my SQL query into my database client and execute it. I have to fiddle about and remove the curly braces and single quotes by hand for it to run. It's annoying to me because I like debugging queries that way. Granted, you can access the compiled SQL in the `target` directory which dbt generates. In fact, there's [a section](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/faqs/checking-logs) in dbt's FAQ about this. But this isn't a design decision which pushes you into [The Pit Of Success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/).

I do however agree with their <span style="color: forestgreen;">first point</span>. It's important to be able to build your tables in different environments, such as development or staging, as well as in production. However, I would argue there are alternative ways to do this. At Alan we had our own dbt-like tool, and we just prepended a schema to our output tables. We didn't need anything like this `ref` function.

## The ugly

Rant aside, the real problem with the `ref` function is that you *can* still write your queries without it. The issue is that when dbt determines the dependencies, builds the execution DAG, and runs the queries in the resulting order, it won't magically indicate you forgot to specify a `ref`. Therefore, if your query $Q$ depends on a table $X$, there's no guarantee that said table $X$ will be refreshed when $Q$ is executed.

This can lead to silent bugs, akin to what Donald Rumsfeld would call [*unknown unknowns*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/There_are_known_knowns). Things get even worse if you start executing views in parallel. Indeed, the bug will become transient and you won't be able to reproduce it in a reliable manner. The result is a recipe for headaches.

Sure, there are ways to avoid this issue. You could visually inspect the execution DAG. You could rely on your colleagues, if you have any, to review your code. You could also add a linter in your CI routine to check this for you. But all these options feel like duct tape to me. By design, a good workflow orchestrator should have guardrails which prevent this issue in the first place.

## A humble suggestion

In my opinion, dbt should determine dependencies by parsing the raw SQL code. The `ref` function shouldn't exist. I gave a piece of Python code above to do this with a regex pattern. But SQL is a formal language, so instead of messing about with regexes, you can use a dedicated parser such as [sqlparse](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse). There's also an example of [extracting table names](https://github.com/macbre/sql-metadata#extracting-tables-from-query) from a query in [sql-metadata](https://github.com/macbre/sql-metadata).

Of course, I don't understand all the ramifications the change I suggest would imply. And I'm sure there are some good reasons why the `ref` function was introduced. Still, I would much rather use a version of dbt that doesn't have the `ref` function. Actually, I'm so adamant on this that I wrote my own dbt-like tool at my day job. It's 240 lines of Python, including empty lines and comments. It doesn't have the all the templating bells and whistles dbt has, but it does the job and makes me feel productive. In particular, it works with views written in SQL as well as Python. Here is the code for posterity:

<details>
  <summary>minidbt.py</summary>

```python
"""

Usage example:

python minidbt.py
python minidbt.py --only view_A --only view_B
python minidbt.py --start view_A
python minidbt.py --end view_B
python minidbt.py --viz

This works for SQL (.sql) as well as Python (.py) views.
The views are assumed to be stored in a views directory.
