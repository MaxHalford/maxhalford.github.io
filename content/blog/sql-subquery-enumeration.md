I recently stumbled on a rather fun problem during my PhD. I wanted to generate all possible subqueries from a given SQL query. In this case an example is easily worth a 1000 thousand words. Take the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
    customers AS c,
    purchases AS p,
    shops AS s
WHERE
    p.customer_id = c.id AND
    p.shop_id = s.id
AND
    c.nationality = 'Swedish' AND
    c.hair = 'Blond' AND
    s.city = 'Stockholm'
```

Here all the possible subqueries that can be generated from the above query.

```sql
-- 1
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'

-- 2
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.hair = 'Blond'

-- 3
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND c.hair = 'Blond'

-- 4
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND p.customer_id = c.id

-- 5
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p
WHERE c.hair = 'Blond'
AND p.customer_id = c.id

-- 6
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND c.hair = 'Blond'
AND p.customer_id = c.id

-- 7
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 8
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.hair = 'Blond'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 9
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND c.hair = 'Blond'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 10
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 11
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.hair = 'Blond'
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 12
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
WHERE c.nationality = 'Swedish'
AND c.hair = 'Blond'
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 13
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c, purchases AS p, shops AS s
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
AND p.customer_id = c.id
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 14
SELECT *
FROM purchases AS p, shops AS s
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
AND p.shop_id = s.id

-- 15
SELECT *
FROM shops AS s
AND s.city = 'Stockholm'
```

You might notice that I've omitted subqueries that don't include a `WHERE` statement. Indeed I'm only interested in queries that filter on some attribute. Regardless, the number of possible subqueries is HUGE in comparison with the simplicity of the query (at least, in my opinion). I'm lazy so I didn't take the time to find a nice formula that could tell me exactly how many subqueries to expect. However I wrote a Python script that enumerates all subqueries and saves to a JSON file. It took me some time to figure out so I thought it would be worth sharing.

I'll go through the steps of my code and then give you the link to the research project I'm using it for on GitHub. The code is rather short and it doesn't require any dependencies. However, the code is a bit of a mouthful and isn't easy to understand without a little effort. Anyway, here goes.

I first wrote a function to parse an SQL query. This function, `parse_query`, returns a 3 `dict`s that contain the different part of the query.

```python
import collections
import re


def remove_whitespaces(string):
    """remove_whitespaces(' cake  ') => 'cake'"""
    return string.lstrip().rstrip()


def replace_between(query):
    """replace_between('BETWEEN 1 AND 3') => '>= 1 AND <= 3'"""
    while 'BETWEEN' in query:
        idx = query.find('BETWEEN')
        right_val = re.search("AND (['a-zA-Z0-9]+)?", query[idx:]).group().split(' ')[1]
        att = remove_whitespaces(query[:idx].split('AND')[-1])
        query = query[:idx] + re.sub(r'AND .+?\s', f'AND {att} <= {right_val}', query[idx:], 1)
        query = query.replace('BETWEEN', '>=', 1)
    return query


def parse_query(query):
    query = query.replace('\n', ' ')

    from_part = query.split('FROM')[1].split('WHERE')[0]
    where_part = query.split('WHERE')[1]
    where_part = replace_between(where_part)

    froms = dict(
        reversed(list(map(remove_whitespaces, name.split('AS'))))
        for name in from_part.split(',')
    )

    joins = {}
    wheres = collections.defaultdict(list)

    # Parse the WHERE statement
    for where in list(map(remove_whitespaces, re.split(r'AND\s*(?![^()]*\))', where_part))):

        if 'OR' in where:
            rel = where.split('.')[0][1:]
            wheres[rel].append(where)
            continue

        op = re.search('|'.join(f'({op})' for op in OPERATORS), where).group()
        left, right = where.split(op)

        left = remove_whitespaces(left)
        right = remove_whitespaces(right)
        op = remove_whitespaces(op)

        if op == '=' and '.' in right:
            l_rel = left.split('.')[0]
            r_rel = right.split('.')[0]
            joins[tuple(sorted([l_rel, r_rel]))] = where
            continue

        rel = left.split('.')[0]
        wheres[rel].append(where)

    return froms, wheres, joins
```

I know, it's not very pretty. But you can at least understand the outputs. `froms` is a `dict` where the keys are the relation aliases and the values are the relation names.

```python
{
    'c': 'customers',
    'p': 'purchases',
    's': 'shops'
}
```

As for `wheres`, it lists the `WHERE` clauses of each relation.

```python
{
    'c': ["c.nationality = 'Swedish'", "c.hair = 'Blond'"],
    's': ["s.city = 'Stockholm'"]
}
```

Finally, `joins` maps pairs of relations to their associated join clause.

```python
{
    ('c', 'p'): 'p.customer_id = c.id',
    ('p', 's'): 'p.shop_id = s.id'
}
```

The `parse_query` function is the weakest part of my script. It relies on the fact that the provided query has a certain structure that I won't dwell on. Basically each relation must have an alias (e.g. `shops AS s`) and the `WHERE` conditions should all be separated by `AND`s (not `OR`s). I tailored this to work for the TPC-DS benchmark queries. If you wanted to reuse my script for other types of queries, then I believe that you would mostly have to tinker with `parse_query`.

The second main function I wrote is called `yield_subqueries`. It's a generator that will return each subquery one by one.

```python
def powerset(iterable):
    """powerset([1,2,3]) => (1,) (2,) (3,) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (1, 2, 3)"""
    s = list(iterable)
    return itertools.chain.from_iterable(
        itertools.combinations(s, r)
        for r in range(1, len(s) + 1)
    )


def yield_subqueries(query):

    froms, wheres, joins = parse_query(query)
    relations = list(sorted(froms.keys()))

    adjacencies = [[0 for _ in range(len(relations))] for _ in range(len(relations))]
    for pair in joins.keys():
        i, j = relations.index(pair[0]), relations.index(pair[1])
        adjacencies[i][j] = adjacencies[j][i] = 1

    combos = set()

    def enum(i, combo, seen):

        candidates = []

        for j, ok in enumerate(adjacencies[i]):
            if j not in seen and ok:
                candidates.append(j)

        for pick in powerset(candidates):
            yield combo + [relations[p] for p in pick]

            for p in pick:
                for new_combo in enum(p, combo + [relations[p] for p in pick], {*seen, *candidates}):
                    yield new_combo

    for i, rel in enumerate(relations):
        combos.add((rel,))
        for combo in enum(i, [rel], {i}):
            combos.add(tuple(sorted(combo)))

    for combo in combos:

        relevant_joins = list(filter(
            None.__ne__,
            [joins.get(tuple(sorted(pair))) for pair in itertools.combinations(combo, 2)]
        ))
        relevant_wheres = list(itertools.chain(*[wheres[r] for r in combo]))

        from_stmt = ', '.join(f'{froms[rel]} AS {rel}' for rel in combo)
        join_stmt = ' AND '.join(relevant_joins)
        sql = f'SELECT * FROM {from_stmt}'
        if join_stmt:
            sql += ' AND ' + join_stmt

        for where_combo in powerset(relevant_wheres):
            subquery = (sql + ' AND ' + ' AND '.join(where_combo)).replace('AND', 'WHERE', 1)
            subquery = subquery = re.sub('\s+', ' ', subquery).strip()
            yield subquery
```

Again, it's hard to understand but it's worked really well for me and is quite fast. The idea is to build an adjacency matrix which tells us which relations each relation is connected to in the query. In our case this would be:

```python
[
    [0, 1, 0],  # customers
    [1, 0, 1],  # purchases
    [0, 1, 0]   # shops
]
```

The idea is to then loop over each row and "walk" the adjacency matrix until having enumerated all possible join combinations. For each join combination we're also going to enumerate all the possible `WHERE` statements. These are called `relevant_joins` and `relevant_wheres`. `combos` is a set that contains all the possible join combinations. I know, it's a bit of a mouthful.

Inside the `main()` of my `script` I simply looped over the TPC-DS benchmark queries and saved all the subqueries I could enumerate.

```python
import glob
import json


def main():

    results = []

    for path in sorted(glob.glob('join-order-benchmark/*.sql')):

        query_name = os.path.basename(path).split(".")[0]
        if query_name in ('fkindexes', 'schema'):
            continue

        # Load and tidy the query
        query = open(path).read().rstrip().rstrip(';')

        # Enumerate the subqueries and save them
        for i, subquery in enumerate(yield_subqueries(query)):
            print(subquery)
            results.append({'mother_query': query_name, 'sql': subquery})

        print(f'Enumerated {i + 1} subqueries for query {query_name}')

        break

    with open('results.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(results, f)
```

I'm sure it's possible to do this faster and with more obvious code, but this is as could I judged necessary with respect to the rest of my PhD work. The full script is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaxHalford/online-selectivity-correction) in the `scripts` directory.

I hope someday this helps someone!
