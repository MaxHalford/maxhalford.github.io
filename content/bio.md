Hello ✌️

I'm a data scientist, currently working for [Carbonfact](https://www.carbonfact.com/). I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. I went to university in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. My academic 🎓 background is a mix of maths 🧮, economics 💸, and computer science 🖥️. I got hooked into data science in 2014 after watching [Moneyball](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Moneyball_(film)) ⚾ and reading [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Signal_and_the_Noise) 📖. My [PhD topic](/blog/phd-about) had to do with database query optimisation and machine learning 🤖. I like to build an interest in different topics, although I do have an area of mild expertise, which is [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning).

I enjoy programming and I [maintain some open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). In particular, I'm one of the founding members of [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) 🌊, which is a Python 🐍 library for online machine learning. I'm a [Kaggle competitions Master](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford) 🏆 and take an interest in competitive data science. I also get a kick out of giving talks and writing blog posts.

Besides work, I like spending time reading 📚, watching movies 🍿, walking 🚶, juggling 🤹, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking 🍲. My favorite snack is a peanut butter 🥜 and banana 🍌 sandwich -- [spatially optimised](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2020/08/25/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwiches/) if possible. My go-to beer is Guinness ☘️. I have a [brother](https://0x5.be/) who's into physics and operating systems. My mother ~~runs a quirky restaurant in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/)~~ -- it closed in October 2021 after 12 years of activity 🍂
