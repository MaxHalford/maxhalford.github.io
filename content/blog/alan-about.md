## Document processing

### Information extraction

A candidate generator + field labeler system, uncannilly like what you can find [here](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p31-sheng-cidr20.pdf) -- Uncannily similar to what I had thought up.

### Line segmentation

Deskewing, like what is done [here](https://muthu.co/deskewing-scanned-documents-using-horizontal-projections/)
